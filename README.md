# Social frends search page "Friends App"

Go to [Demo](https://kalash14.github.io/friends-app/)

It was the last task from advanced topic in [Kottans](https://github.com/kottans/) frontend [course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend)

Here I've created a tiny social friends' search page with users cards,
search, sorting and filtering of them by age and name with [Random User API](https://randomuser.me)

To my mind, this final task contains all knowledge from Kottans frontend course, because here I've used technologies from this list:

* different Array methods;
* ES6 template strings in rendering persons blocks;
* using Fetch method for getting data from API;
* sort methods;
* performance optimization - using event throttling (debounce function), when user scrolls page and filter sidebar becomes fixed;
* DOM manipulation;
* basics of design, color palettes and responsive design

Also in this task I got stuck with filters and I decided to use some instance, where I could strore current filter state.

After finishing this task I've got a huge experience with getting data from some API and further processing and displaying it on UI.
